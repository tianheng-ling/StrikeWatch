## StrikeWatch Dataset

The **StrikeWatch dataset** was collected for running gait classification (forefoot vs. heel strike) using 3-axis IMU data from a custom wrist-worn device. Data was recorded from **twelve participants** during real-world outdoor running sessions. In addition to raw accelerometer readings, the magnitude signal (computed as \( a = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2} \)) is also included.
